With contributions by: insert LA helpers here

This is the repository that will store all of the chapters to the Introduction to Engineering book. Each chapter will be stored in it's own folder named "Chapter X". Where X is the number...you get the idea. Inside each of the chapter folders will be multiple sub-folders as follows:

* Media - All of the pictures and downloadable files from the chapters.
* Homework - All of the word documents containing the homework files. Solutions are available to instructors by emailing samuel.bechara@colostate.edu and proving you are a professor.
